# GBA-Codebreaker-FCD-0022
The full schematic, PCB, and flash dump of the GBA Codebreaker. There are two distinct flash dumps, both from different Codebreakers. I have not yet determined version information for them. The original PCB is a 4-layer PCB, though it isn't necessary in order to route everything.

PCB Thickness: 0.8 mm
